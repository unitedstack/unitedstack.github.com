    <h2>UnitedStack is On the Way,Without the media, nor a press conference, UnitedStack Inc., an OpenStack company was quietly set up in Silicon Valley in Feb 2013. Without distinguished background, nor the founders are  large bowl, just a bunch of engineers from Internet companies and the open source community, we will use the methodology of building Internet products and attitude of open source to run a different company.</h2>
    <h3>“Cloud Computing”, once it was a good technical term, but for so many years it is by major IT giants or shell companies packed into various concepts to fool government, enterprises and users, and the bubble has already blown in China for six to seven years, and it’s likely to get worse, if we do not stand out, the industry will continue to become a paradise for speculators, and pretenders’ money-making tools.</h3>
    <h4>We believe that the real cloud computing should be a united and standard infrastructure and open platform, it is able to integrate the physical resources of the data center and make them virtualized and service-oriented to support a variety of enterprise applications,  with no vendor lock-in and binding. To evaluate the worth of a cloud computing product,  we should not go to the well-designed product manuals, nor do we need to listen to the cloud architects’ boast, what you have to do is just go with it, experience it, and then assess whether it solves the problems, and whether it is easy to use, whether it is self-service, no need to go through training, whether it has good scalability in the future, and so on.</h4>
